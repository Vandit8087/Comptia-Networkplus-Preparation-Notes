NATConnect: VM Network Interaction & Packet Analysis

Project Overview:

This project showcases network communication between two Virtual Machines—Kali Linux and Windows 10—connected on the same NAT network in VMware Workstation Pro. The primary goal was to establish connectivity via the ping command and perform in-depth network traffic analysis using Wireshark on both VMs.

Features
Configured and verified VM IP addresses on NAT network

Used ICMP (ping) commands to test connectivity between Kali Linux and Windows 10

Captured and analyzed network packets bi-directionally using Wireshark

Troubleshot connectivity issues including Windows Defender Firewall blocking pings

Observed real-time ICMP packet exchanges and network traffic patterns

Setup & Configuration
Environment:

VMware Workstation Pro

Kali Linux VM and Windows 10 VM

Both VMs set to use the same NAT network adapter

Network Configuration:

On Kali Linux: Used ifconfig to check IP — e.g., 192.168.133.131

On Windows 10: Used ipconfig to verify IP — e.g., 192.168.133.133

Connectivity Testing:

From Kali Linux, pinged Windows 10 IP to verify communication.

Initial tests showed 100% packet loss due to firewall restrictions.

Disabled Windows Defender Firewall on Windows 10 to enable ping responses.

Packet Capture & Analysis:

Ran Wireshark on both Kali Linux and Windows 10 VMs simultaneously.

Captured ICMP Echo Request and Reply packets for detailed inspection.

Analyzed packet timestamps, TTL values, and data payloads demonstrating successful two-way communication post firewall adjustment.

Usage
Start both VMs in VMware Workstation Pro with NAT enabled.

Confirm IP addresses on both VMs.

Run ping from Kali Linux to Windows 10 to test network connectivity.

Launch Wireshark on either or both VMs.

Capture traffic on the respective network interfaces.

Observe ICMP requests and replies relevant to your ping tests.

Troubleshoot firewall if ping does not succeed initially.

Key Takeaways
NAT networking in VMware Workstation Pro allows inter-VM communication on a private subnet.

Windows Defender Firewall blocks ICMP packets by default; disabling or configuring it is essential for ping tests.

Wireshark is a powerful utility to visualize and analyze network traffic in real-time.

Packet captures provide insight into the underlying protocols enabling connectivity between the VMs.

How to Reproduce
Set up Kali Linux and Windows 10 VMs on the same NAT network in VMware.

Confirm the network configuration on each VM.

Use ping to verify connectivity.

Use Wireshark to capture and analyze traffic.

Adjust firewall settings if ICMP requests are blocked.

Document network interactions for learning or troubleshooting.
